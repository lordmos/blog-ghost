The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default.

In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, #video==\\n\\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of `News`, and `Cycling` - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with `#video`.\\n\\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:\\n\\n```\\n{{#post}}\\n    {{#has tag=\\\"#video\\\"}}\\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\\n    {{else}}\\n        ...regular markup for a post...\\n    {{/has}}\\n{{/post}}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive [theme documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else.
